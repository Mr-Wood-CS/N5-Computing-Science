# Entities and Attributes

A database can have more than one table. 

When we are designing the table, it is called an entity.

Tables are made up of fields and records.

A field holds one piece of data at a time - e.g. a personâ€™s name, age or phone number.

A field is also known as an attribute.

This is a table - or entity - with five fields (or five attributes)  and four records.

The table has five fields - name, age, nickname, address, and height. It also has four records. In terms of entities and attributes, the person entity has five attributes - name, age, nickname, address and height.
