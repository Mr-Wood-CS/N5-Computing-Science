# Primary And Foreign Keys

The primary key is a field that uniquely identifies each record. For example:

Everyone has a unique SQA candidate number.

Cars have a unique registration.

You need to be able to identify the primary key from a table.

When a field from one table or entity appears in another table or entity, it is called a foreign key.

The foreign key is a field that both tables have in common.

In this example, MovieID is the primary key for Movie, and DirectorID is the primary key for Director.

Because DirectorID - the primary key from Director - also appears in the Movie table, that makes it a foreign key.
