# Database Relationships (One to Many)

Database relationships can be shown in the form of a diagram. 

This diagram is known as an 'entity relationship diagram'. 

As part of your exam, you will have to either draw or interpret one of these diagrams. 

A one-to-many relationship is the most common type of relationship between database entities. In this type of relationship, a row in table A can have many matching rows in table B, but a row in table B can have only one matching row in table A. 

For example, the publishers and titles tables have a one-to-many relationship: each publisher produces many titles, but each title comes from only one publisher.

Think about a mother and her children. A mother can have many children. A child can have only one mother.
