# Initialising an Array

If we know what the initial values of the array are, we can state them in the code. 

Consider the list of  scores from earlier:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![List Example](../Images/List3.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

We would write this at the start of the program:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]
```
