# Accessing Elements in an Array

If we want to use one of the elements in the array, we can refer to it by number.

So, to get 18 from the list of scores (element 3), we would say:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

find_score = scores[3]
```
We put the number of the element in square brackets. 

==Remember that element numbers start at zero.==

It doesn’t ,however, need to be a literal number in the square brackets. 

If we had a variable (this one is called counter), we could put that in the square brackets to get the `“counter-nth”` element:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

counter = 4

print(scores[counter])
```

The above program would output the `4th element`, `17`
