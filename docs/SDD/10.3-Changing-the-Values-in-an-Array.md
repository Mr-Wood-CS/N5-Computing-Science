# Changing the Values in Array

In addition, we can also change the data stored in each element, including with calculations:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores[0] = 17
scores[1] = 19
scores[4] = scores[2]
scores[5] = 5 * 3
scores[6] = scores[2] + 1
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12]
```
