# Appending to an Array

Python `append()` function enables us to add an element to the end of an array. 

You would use Python `append()` when you are adding to new items to the ==end of a list==


```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores.append(56)
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12, 56]
```
