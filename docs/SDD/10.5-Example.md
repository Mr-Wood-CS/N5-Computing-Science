    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Initialise the favorite_books list to hold five book titles. 
        
        Each number in the list represents a temperature reading.

        `Line 3`

        The program directly accesses the element at index ([0] for the first book and [2] for the third book). 

        `Line 5`

        The program directly accesses the element at index [2].
        
        
        `Line 7`

        The program assigns a new value to favorite_books at the index value[3]

        `Line 9` 

        The program outputs the `updated`list of books.
