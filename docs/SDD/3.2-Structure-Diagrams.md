# Structure Diagrams

A structure diagram (or structure chart) is the first design notation. ==We use these to break down the task into smaller chunks==.

The structure diagram is useful for showing the sequence of steps needed to solve the problem. It is always read from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.

Let’s look at one of the problems you carried out an analysis on, earlier:

A program that asks for the user’s username and password, checks if they are correct, and tells them whether or not they have been granted access.

We start with the main task/problem, and put this in the top box.

We can break the structure diagram into roughly three parts: the inputs, the process and the outputs.

These have to be done in order from left to right:

1. Get the username and password
2. Check if they are valid
3. Tell the user if they have access
