# Structure Diagrams

A structure diagram (or structure chart) is the first design notation. ==We use these to break down the task into smaller chunks==.

The structure diagram is useful for showing the sequence of steps needed to solve the problem. It is always read from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.

??? example "Example 1"

    > You have been asked to create a program that asks for the userâ€™s username and password, checks if they are correct, and tells them whether or not they have been granted access.
    
    * We start with the main task/problem, and put this in the top box.
    
    * We can break the structure diagram into roughly three parts: the `inputs`, the `process` and the `outputs`.
    
    These have to be done in order from left to right:
    
    1. Get the username and password
    2. Check if they are valid
    3. Tell the user if they have access

    We can break this diagram down further. 
    
    The first step (get the username and password) can be broken down into two more blocks: 
    
    * get the username
      
    * get the password


??? example "Example 2"

    > You have been asked to create a program that asks for two numbers, calculates the total and displays the total on screen.
    
    * We start with the main task/problem, and put this in the top box.
    
    * We can break the structure diagram into roughly three parts: the `inputs`, the `process` and the `outputs`.
    
    These have to be done in order from left to right:
    
    1. Get the two numbers
    2. Calculate the total
    3. Display the total on screen

So far, you structure diagrams have used the same symbol (==process, meaning it does something==).

There are four different symbols that can be used on a structure diagram.

??? example "Example 3"

    > You have been asked to create a program that asks for five numbers, calculates the total and displays the total on screen.
    
    * We start with the main task/problem, and put this in the top box.
    
    * We can break the structure diagram into roughly three parts: the `inputs`, the `process` and the `outputs`.
    
    These have to be done in order from left to right:
    
    1. Get the five numbers
    2. Calculate the total
    3. Display the total on screen
