# Pseudocode

Pseudocode (pronounced sudo-code) is a way of planning your program line-by-line, without writing actual code.

    Pseudocode isnâ€™t as strict as a real programming language. 
    
    We write pseudocode in English. 
    
    There are no fixed rules for how it should look. 

==So long as you break the problem down into steps, and your meaning is clear, you can be awarded the marks.==

You will get more used to seeing pseudocode as you work on practical tasks, as lots of the examples will use it for their design.

The SQA gives the following example of pseudocode to calculate the volume of a swimming pool.

First, we break the problem down into steps:

1. Ask user to enter dimensions of the swimming pool in metres
   
2. Calculate volume of pool `(length * width * depth)`
   
3. Display message stating the volume of the pool

For step 1 (ask the user to enter dimensions), we can break this down further into 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. 

==These are called refinements.== 

Each refined line could later be translated straight into a line of program code.
