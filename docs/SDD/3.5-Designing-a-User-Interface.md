# Wireframe Diagrams

For software development, all you have to do is sketch a (`rough`) interface based on the inputs and outputs.

The actual programs we create in Python don’t have buttons. However, you can draw a wireframe design with buttons and textboxes if you wish.

In practice, most of your program interfaces will be made up of lines of text:

> Please enter your name: John
> 
> Please enter how many tickets you would like: 5
>
> You have asked for 5 tickets. That will cost £25

In this example, there are two inputs (name and number of tickets), and one output (the cost).

All you have to do is draw a (`reasonable`) interface with the right inputs and outputs. 

If you were asked to draw an interface for a calculator program, that asks for two numbers, and multiplies the result, it could be something like:

`Please enter first number: _____`
`Please enter second number: _____`
`Total multiplied is _____`
