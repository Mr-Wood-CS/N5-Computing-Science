# Wireframe Diagrams

For software development, all you have to do is sketch a (`rough``) interface based on the inputs and outputs.

The actual programs we create in Python don’t have buttons. However, you can draw a wireframe design with buttons and textboxes if you wish.

In practice, most of your program interfaces will be made up of lines of text:

> Please enter your name: John
> Please enter how many tickets you would like: 5
>
> You have asked for 5 tickets. That will cost £25
