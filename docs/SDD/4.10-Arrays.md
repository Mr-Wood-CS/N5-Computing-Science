# Arrays

## Explanation

Imagine you have been asked to create a program that asks for 3 test scores, adds them together, and prints out the total.

It could probably start with something like this:

``` python linenums="1"

score1 = int(input("Please enter first score"))
score2 = int(input("Please enter second score"))
score3 = int(input("Please enter third score"))
```

What happens when we need a program that asks for 20 scores? Or 100? 

We could write out every variable, but it would be a very long program, and the chance for mistakes is high. 

Instead, we need an array.

An array is simaler to a variable. 

Only this variable, can store multiple values. 

This is called an array. Where a normal variable stores data in one memory location , an array reserves a whole set of memory locations, one after the other. 

In `Python` an array is known a list:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![List Example](../Images/List2.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

In the example array above, there are 9 elements. Each item makes up one element of the array. 

We start counting the elements from 0 (instead of 1). 

So element 0 in that array is 15, element 1 is 20, and element 7 is 19 and so on.

Like variables, arrays have data types (a string array, an integer array, a Boolean array, etc.)

When you see the term ==data structure==, this refers to a ==variable== or an ==array==.

#### Initialising an Array

If we know what the initial values of the array are, we can state them in the code. 

Consider the list of  scores from earlier:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![List Example](../Images/List3.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

We would write this at the start of the program:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]
```

#### Working with Elements in an Array

If we want to use one of the elements in the array, we can refer to it by number.

So, to get 18 from the list of scores (element 3), we would say:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

find_score = scores[3]
```
We put the number of the element in square brackets. 

==Remember that element numbers start at zero.==

It doesn’t ,however, need to be a literal number in the square brackets. 

If we had a variable (this one is called counter), we could put that in the square brackets to get the `“counter-nth”` element:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

counter = 4

print(scores[counter])
```

The above program would output the `4th element`, `17`

#### Changing the Values in Array

In addition, we can also change the data stored in each element, including with calculations:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores[0] = 17
scores[1] = 19
scores[4] = scores[2]
scores[5] = 5 * 3
scores[6] = scores[2] + 1
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12]
```

#### Appending to an Array

Python `append()` function enables us to add an element to the end of another array. 

You would use Python `append()` when you are adding to new items to the ==end of a list==


```python linenums="1"
scores = [15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 20, 16, 19, 12]

scores.append(56)
```

The updated list would now look like this:

```python linenums="1"
scores = [17, 19, 19, 18, 19, 15, 20, 19, 12, 56]
```

#### Real World Example

!!! example "The Library Program"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        favorite_books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "1984", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "The Great Gatsby"]

        print("The first book in the list is:", favorite_books[0])

        print("The third book in the list is:", favorite_books[2])

        favorite_books[3] = "Pride and Prejudice"

        print("The updated list of books is:", favorite_books)
        ```
    === "Pseudocode"

        ``` pseudocode 
        
        > Main Steps
        
        1.0 - Create days of the week array
        2.0 - Display and update books
        3.0 - Output updated book list

        > Refinements

        1.1 - Create array
        1.2 - Add Harry Potter, The Hobbit, 1984, To Kill a Mockingbird and The Great Gatsby to array

        2.1 - Ouput message and the book title that is first in the list.
        2.2 - Ouput message and the book title that is third in the list.
        2.3 - Replace book 3 with Pride and Prejudice
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Initialise the favorite_books list to hold five book titles. 
        
        Each number in the list represents a temperature reading.

        `Line 3`

        The program directly accesses the element at index ([0] for the first book and [2] for the third book). 

        `Line 5`

        The program directly accesses the element at index [2].
        
        
        `Line 7`

        The program assigns a new value to favorite_books at the index value[3]

        `Line 9` 

        The program outputs the `updated`list of books.

### Traversing a 1d Array (standard algorithm)

We know that arrays are used for storing a list of data.

The key benfit of arrays is that they reduce repetition. For example:

``` python title="Without an Array" linenums="1"
var_1 = 1
var_2 = 2
var_3 = 3
var_4 = 4
var_5 = 5
```

```python title="With an Array" linenums="1"
var_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

We also know that loops are used to reduce repetition in our lines of code. For example: 

We can use a loop to traverse the array - that means, to travel through it, or loop through it.

Traversing an array is one of the standard algorithms.

``` python title="Without a Loop" linenums="1"
print (1)
print (2)
print (3)
print (4)
print (5)
```
``` python title="With a Loop" linenums="1"
for i in range(1,6):
    print (i)
```

!!! info "The Steps to This Algorithm are:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Start a for loop, for the number of elements in the array
            2.0 - Use the array element[counter]
    3.0 - End for loop
    ```


#### Using a Loop to Traverse an Array

In programming we use loops to traverse the elements of an array. 

Example: 

!!! example "The Snow White Program"

    === "Code"

        ``` python linenums="1"
        names = [“Dopey”, “Grumpy”, “Doc”, “Bashful”, “Sneezy”, “Sleepy”, “Happy”]
        
        for counter in range(0, 7):
            print(names[counter])
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Initialise the names list to hold 7 names.

        `Line 2`

        Start a loop that from 0 to 6 and print the name

        `Line 4`

        On each `iteration of the loop` output the data that is held within that element of the array.

!!! tip "Remember"

    Remember that the word counter is just a variable name. 
    
    It could be anything:

    ``` python  hl_lines="3 4" linenums="1"

    names = [“Dopey”, “Grumpy”, “Doc”, “Bashful”, “Sneezy”, “Sleepy”, “Happy”]
        
    for bannanas in range(0, 7):
        print(names[bannanas])
    ```
