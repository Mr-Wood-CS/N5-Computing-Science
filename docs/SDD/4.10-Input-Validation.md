# Input Validation

When you’re filling in a form - on a website, for example - it will often contain input validation. 

This means that it checks you have entered the right type of data in each place. 

Note: it’s not checking that the data is actually correct, just that it is the right sort of data. If it wants a number, it (hopefully)  won’t let you enter “hello123dinosaur$”

Other everyday examples of input validation:

* Your password must be (for example) at least 6 characters long.

* Your age must be an integer (whole number) and cannot be less than 0.

* A percentage that cannot be less than 0 or greater than 100

!!! example "Example"

    Below is an example of an ==Input Validation== `Standard Algorithm` that is required for National 5. 

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        age = int(input("Please enter a valid age"))

        while age < 15:
            print("Sorry, you must be 15 or over")
            age = int(input("Please enter a valid age"))    
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        The program asks the user to enter a valid age
        
        `Line 3`

        A while loop checks if the entered age is less than 15.

        `Line 4`

        If `line 3` = ==true==, the program informs the user that they must be 15 or over.
        
        `Line 3` 

        The program asks the user to enter their age again.
    
    This program could be improved further by providing clearer prompts.

    

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

        if age >= 15:

            print("Age accepted.")
            
        else:

            age = int(input("Sorry, you must be 15 or over. Please enter your age again: ")) 
        ```

        `Line 1`

        If `line 3` = ==true==, the program informs the user that they must be 15 or over.
        
        `Line 3` 

        The program asks the user to enter their age again.
