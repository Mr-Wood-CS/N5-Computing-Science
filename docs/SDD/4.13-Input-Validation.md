# Input Validation

When you’re filling in a form - on a website, for example - it will often contain input validation. 

This means that it checks you have entered the right type of data in each place. 

Note: it’s not checking that the data is actually correct, just that it is the right sort of data. If it wants a number, it (hopefully)  won’t let you enter “hello123dinosaur$”

Other everyday examples of input validation:

* Your password must be (for example) at least 6 characters long.

* Your age must be an integer (whole number) and cannot be less than 0.

* A percentage that cannot be less than 0 or greater than 100

!!! info "Input validation will always use a conditional loop. The steps of this algorithm are:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Ask the user to input something

    2.0 - Start a while loop, while the input does not meet the condition (e.g. while age < 15)
            
            3.0 - Show an error message
            
            4.0 - Ask the user to input (again)
    
    5.0 - End while loop
    ```
    
Below is an example of an ==Input Validation== `Standard Algorithm` that is ==required== at National 5. 

!!! example "Number Check Program (using simple conditional statements)"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        user_input = int(input("Please enter a number that is greater the 14"))

        while user_input < 16:

            print("Sorry, your number must be greater than 15")
            
            user_input = int(input("Please enter a valid number")) 
            
        print("Number accepted.")
            
           
                   
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        The program asks the user to enter a number ==greater== than 15.
        
        `Line 3`

        A ==Conditional Loop== (`while loop`) checks if the inputted number is ==less== than 16.

        `Line 5`

        If `line 3` = ==true==, the program informs the user that the number must be ==greater== than 15.
        
        `Line 7` 

        The program asks the user to input another number.

        `Line 9` 

        If the number is greater than 15 `Number accepted is displayed` ==outside== of the while loop. 

        !!! warning "Important"

            If `Number accepted`is placed ==inside== the while loop, your program will become stuck in an indefinate loop! This is an easy way to fail your practical assessment. ==Remember to always double check your code!==
    
## Input Validation Using Complex Conditional Statements

Using the above as a template, we can now edit our program to include more advanced programming techniques.

!!! example "Number Check Program (using complex conditional statements)"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        user_input = int(input("Please enter a number between 1 and 10: "))

        while user_input < 1 and user_input > 10:

            print("Sorry, your number must be greater than 0 and less than 11")
                
            user_input = int(input("Please enter a valid number")) 
                
        print("Number accepted.")
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        The program asks the user to enter a valid age

        `Line 3`

        A while loop checks if the entered age is less than 15.

        `Line 4`

        If `line 3` = ==true==, the program informs the user that they must be 15 or over.

        `Line 3` 

        The program asks the user to enter their age again.

## Real World Example

!!! example "User Account Login Program"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        username = "user1"
        password = "pass1"

        attempts = 0
        account_access = False

        while attempts < 3:

            user_username = input("Please enter your username: ")
            user_password = input("Please enter your password: ")

            if user_username == username and user_password == password:
                
                print("Username and Password Accepted")

                account_access = True

                break

            else:
                print("Incorrect, please try again")

                attempts = attempts + 1

        if not account_access:

            print("Too many attempts. Account locked. Please try later")        
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Sets the correct username to `user1`.
        
        `Line 2`

        Sets the correct password to `pass1`. 

        `Line 4`

        Keeps track of how many times you have tried to log in. 
        
        At the start, you haven't tried yet, so it is set to `0`.
        
        `Line 5` 

        This is like a switch that starts as `off`.
        
        It will only turn `on` (==become True==) if you enter the correct username and password.

        `Line 7` 

        Start of the ==conditional loop== that will keep running as long as you've tried fewer than 3 times. 
        
        Once you reach 3 tries, the loop stops.


        `Line 9` 

        The user is asked to input their username.
        
        This is stored in the user_username `variable`.

        `Line 10` 

        The user is asked to input their password.
        
        This is stored in the user_password `variable`.

        `Line 12` 

        Performs a check to see if the input (==user_username== and ==user_password==) matches the correct username and password. 
        
        ==Both must be correct to continue.==

        `Line 14` 

        If both the `username` and `password` are correct, the =="Username and Password Accepted"== message is ouputted. 

        `Line 16` 

        This turns the `switch` to `on` and lets the program know that you now have access to your account.

        `Line 18` 

        This stops the loop because you have successfully logged in.

        `Line 20` 

        If the username and password are incorrect, èlse`is selected.

        `Line 21` 

        Outputs the message =="Incorrect, please try again"==

        `Line 23` 

        Adds 1 to the `Attempts` ==variable==.
        
        Doing so allows the program to keep track of how many times you’ve tried to log in.

        `Line 25` 

        After the loop ends, the program checks if you managed to log in. `if not account_access` is simply asking ==" Is user_access now set to True?"==
        
        `Line 27`

        As `account_access` is still set to `False` the message =="Too many attempts. Account locked. Please try later"== is outputted.
