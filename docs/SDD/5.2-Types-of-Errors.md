# Types of Errors

There are three types of programming errors that you need to know about - syntax, logic and execution.

If you’re given an example of an error, you need to be able to say what type it is.

Syntax and logic errors occur when you are writing the program; 

execution errors happen when the program is running. 

Of these, syntax errors are usually the easiest to spot.

==Good test data helps you to find and minimise these errors.==

#### Synatx Errors

Syntax errors are quite common. You will already have experienced lots of these!

Syntax errors happen when you make a mistake in typing your code. 

These could be spelling mistakes, typing words in the wrong order, or using the wrong symbols.

For example:

* priiiint instead of print
* print(“Hello,” name) instead of print(“Hello”, name)
* range[0, 10] when it should be range(0, 10)

==Syntax errors are about breaking the rules of the language in some way.==

In Python (specifically), you would see an error message. 

==Look at the message carefully== - it tells you which line the error is on (**so you don’t need to check your whole program**).

When you’re doing practical tasks, watch out for these common syntax errors in Python. 

If you’re not sure what’s causing an error, come back to this page and check your code to see if you’ve included one!

=== "Common Errors"

    `Number 1`

    ``` python linenums="1"
    
    print (Hello World) 
    
    ```

=== "Explanation"
    
    Forgetting to add speech marks around a string. It should be (“Hello world”).


| Common Error                                | Explanation                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| print(Hello world)                          | Forgetting to add speech marks around a string. It should be (“Hello world”). |
| ``` if age = 17: <br /> print(“You can drive”)``` | Should be the double-equals ==                                                |



if age = 17:
 print(“You can drive”)                                    | Should be the double-equals = =

Remember to use = = when you’re checking if two things are equal                                  |
| for counter in range(0, 10)

print(“This happens 10 times”)              | Forgot to indent. The line that repeats (print) should be indented so it’s inside the loop.                                        |
| if age >= 17

  print(“You can drive”)

else:

 print(“You can’t drive”) | Missing the colon :  at the end of the first line. If, else and loops should always have a colon, e.g.

if age >= 17:

 print(...) |
