      Describe, identify, and exemplify the evaluation of a solution in terms of:
      
      * fitness for purpose
      * efficient use of coding constructs
      * robustness
      * readability:
      
          — internal commentary
          
          — meaningful identifiers
          
          — indentation
          
          — white space
          
You have to be able to evaluate a program - either yours, or one you’re given - in four categories:

* Fitness for purpose
* Efficient use of coding constructs
* Robustness
* Readability

These are very important. 

You’ll usually be asked for two of these in the assignment. 

You have to be able to give examples that fit all of these types of evaluation.

{ == 

In the course assignment, it’s really important that you evaluate your own program accurately. If you say that your program is readable, and it isn’t, you would not get the mark. If you evaluate that your program isn’t as readable as it could be, and that’s correct, you would get the mark. In the assignment, the marks are for being honest.
