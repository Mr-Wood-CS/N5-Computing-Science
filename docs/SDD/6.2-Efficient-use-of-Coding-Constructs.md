# Efficient use of Coding Constructs

Efficient use of coding constructs can seem confusing at first. When the SQA give you this in an exam or the assignment, they tend to be really clear - they usually give you a really bad program thatâ€™s very inefficient.

Efficiency is about using as few lines as possible. 

!!! example

    === "Inefficent"
    
        ``` python linenums="1"      
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        ```
    
    === "Efficent"
    
        ``` python linenums="1"      
        for loop in range(0, 5):
            print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        ```
