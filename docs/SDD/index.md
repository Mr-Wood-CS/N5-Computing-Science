# Unit 1 - Software Design and Development

Welcome to Software Design and Development, one of the most exciting parts of the SQA National 5 Computing Science course! 

Here, you’ll learn how the apps, games, and programs you use every day are made—and get to create some of your own. 

Whether you’re into gaming, solving puzzles, or just curious about how programming works, this unit covers it all.  

Think about your favorite app or game. Behind the scenes, someone had to plan how it works, design how it looks, and write the instructions (called code) to make it all happen. 

==That’s software design and development in action!== 

It’s like building something from scratch but using your brain and a computer instead of bricks and mortar.  

In this part of the course, we’ll explore how software is created step by step. 

You’ll learn how to break problems into smaller chunks, think logically, and solve challenges creatively. 

You’ll also get hands-on programming experience with Python, where you’ll write your own code to make interactive programs.  

**But it’s not just about writing code.**

We’ll also look at how to design programs so they’re easy to use, spot and fix mistakes (debugging), and make sure everything works as planned. 

==These skills aren’t just for programmers—they’re useful for lots of careers and even everyday life.== 

Don’t worry if you’ve never written a line of code before. Everyone starts somewhere, and you’ll get plenty of guidance. 

By the end of this unit, you’ll have the tools to bring your own ideas to life. Who knows? You might even create the next big app or game!
